Analyzing sentiment in the Myntra dataset through machine learning and TextBlob. Cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and visualization included.

# Overview
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sentiment in the Myntra dataset using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The main goal of this project is to uncover insights from customer reviews and opinions expressed in the dataset, gaining a deeper understanding of customer sentiment towards different products. The project covers various stages, from data preprocessing to advanced machine learning modeling, along with visualizations to present the findings.

# Contents
Data Cleaning: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning to handle missing values, remove noise, and ensure high data quality for subsequent analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An in-depth exploration of the dataset is conducted, revealing key trends, distributions, and patterns within the data. EDA provides insights into the characteristics of the reviews and sentiments.
Feature Engineering: New features are created or extracted from the existing data to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models. These features might include text-based features, sentiment scores, and more.
Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob: The TextBlob library is utilized to perform sentiment analysis on the text reviews. This involves classifying the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral, providing a baseline for the project.
Machine Learning Models: A variety of machine learning algorithms are applied to predict sentiment labels based on the review text and engineered features. Models such as RandomForest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting are trained and evaluated.
Visualization: Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate the findings of the analysis. Plots, graphs, and heatmaps are used to convey patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each machine learning model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in selecting the best model for sentiment prediction.
Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of the insights gained from the analysis. It highlights the main factors influencing sentiment, product preferences, and potential areas of improvement for Myntra.
